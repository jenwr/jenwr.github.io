## Olympic National Park

Ask about the tide schedule. 

Things to do: 
- Ozette Loop Trail, coastal hiking at its best, 9 miles, far northwest corner of this landmass. Bald eagles! Pay attention, at high tide you cannot circumnavigate the trail. 
- South Coast Trail. This one is difficult, but note the tide pools. Find a doable hike with access to tide pools. 
- Hurricane Ridge, scenic drive. Amazing views and access to hiking trails. One reviewer recommends skipping this drive as it is similar to Mt Ranier with respect to views and forests. Focus on Hoh Rain Forest and Ruby or Rialto Beach.
