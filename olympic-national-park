## Olympic National Park

Ask about the tide schedule. 

Things to do: 
- Ozette Loop Trail, coastal hiking at its best, 9 miles, far northwest corner of this landmass. Bald eagles! Pay attention, at high tide you cannot circumnavigate the trail. 
- South Coast Trail. This one is difficult, but note the tide pools. Find a doable hike with access to tide pools. 
- Hurricane Ridge, scenic drive. Amazing views and access to hiking trails. One reviewer recommends skipping this drive as it is similar to Mt Ranier with respect to views and forests. Focus on Hoh Rain Forest and Ruby or Rialto Beach.
- Ruby Beach, go at low tide and see starfish and sea anenomes. Enjoy impressive sea stacks, rock formations, and drift wood. 
- Rialto Beach with Hole in the Wall, similar to Ruby Beach with starfish and anenomes during low tide. Pack a picnic lunch. There are restrooms, picnic tables, and parking lot. Hiking trails in the woods or you can stroll the beach. For lodging check Olympic-National. 
- Hoh Rain Forest with three trails. Try the Hall of Mos Trail first. LONG DRIVE to get here. 
- Hoh River Trail to Five Mile Island and back, 10 miles, 6 hours.
