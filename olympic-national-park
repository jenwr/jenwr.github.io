## Olympic National Park

Things to do: 
- Hurricane Ridge, scenic drive. Amazing views and access to hiking trails. One reviewer recommends skipping this drive as it is similar to Mt Ranier with respect to views and forests. Focus on Hoh Rain Forest and Ruby or Rialto Beach.
- Ruby Beach, go at low tide and see starfish and sea anenomes. Enjoy impressive sea stacks, rock formations, and drift wood. 
- Rialto Beach with Hole in the Wall, similar to Ruby Beach with starfish and anenomes during low tide. There are restrooms, picnic tables, and parking lot. Hiking trails in the woods or you can stroll the beach. For lodging check Olympic-National. 
- Second Beach, with a super low tide one can walk to the sea stacks on the sand - no need to get wet. The starfish and anenomes cling to the walls of the seastacks. 
- Hoh Rain Forest with three trails. Try the Hall of Moss Trail first. LONG DRIVE to get here.
